# intrigus-lgtm - Security Research

Public disclosure channel for disclosing security vulnerabilities I've discovered.

[Take me to the research!](https://github.com/intrigus-lgtm/security-research/security/advisories)

## Why

I report a relatively high number of security vulnerabilities. Particularily to OSS projects.

Unfortunately, I've discovered that I'm spending a lot of my time chasing down maintainers, asking them to open GitHub Security Advisories, or trying to make contact via email. I've realized that this "making contact" phase is where a majority of my time/resources/energy was being spent. Additionally, my time/resources are spent ensuring the maintainers follow up on fixes and that disclosure occurs. I find that I'm not spending time on actual security research.

The goal of this repository is to invert the relationship. I create advisories, and invite the maintainers to participate in the advisory.

Should the maintainer wish to move the discussion/fix/disclosure to a GitHub Security Advisory against their own repository, I'm happy to do that.
However, this channel provides an easy way for me to enforce my disclosure policy in a consistent and fair way.


## My Disclosure Policy

**My vulnerability disclosure follows the GitHub Security Lab [vulnerability disclosure policy](https://securitylab.github.com/advisories#policy) (I'm not an employee of Github, I just like their policy).**
